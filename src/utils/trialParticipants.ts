I am a very pale porcelain colour without tan and had to go swimming this week. So, I put this on just over an hour before I had to go swimming. I washed it off after exactly one hour and was left with a full lovely tan. I got a lot of compliments from my friends and they said it looked great. It made me feel so much more confident at the pool. Plus, it‚Äôs super blendable if you miss a spot‚Äîlove that!\n"
